  As of 2/26/1016, Access Tokens using GitHub's oauth2 in an organization requires approval than a callbackURL, where the access token is sent to.
  In order to request this token, you must have a client_ID and a Client_Secret.  This can be found in
  the Org's user setting on github.com when you when you register a new OAuth application.  Here the user should
  select the scopes 'repo' and the appropriate corresponding subsequent scopes you desire in the repository creation process.
  Since you need a callback URL, the user may want to consider a third party web client such as Google's PostMan in
  order to make the request and generate the token.  Once the user has acquired this token, they may reuse it.
